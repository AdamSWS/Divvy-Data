# Divvy-Data

Project I did for school.

This program was for school. Works with large datasets of previous ride logs in Excel files and outputs readable info for user, such as length of trip, tripID, start location, end location, and trip distance. This also can display the percentages of casual to member riders as double % and the total rides per hour in the day. There is a graphing display as well showing rides during week days to week end.
